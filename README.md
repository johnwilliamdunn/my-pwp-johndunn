## Milestones 1 Feedback

Purpose, Audience, and Goal are clear and concise. I understand your intention for this site but also keep in mind for future projects to have more detail in these sections. It will help define who you're trying to reach with a website. The personas you created are thoughtful and detailed. I look forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2α.

Your project and files are all set up to spec. Your code may need some clean up. There should not be any inline styling. I noticed a few height & width adjustments on your image tags. Also, the closing li tags should be at the end of every line. It does not need to be on a new line.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2α.
