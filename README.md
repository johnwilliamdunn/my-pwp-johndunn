## Milestones 1 Feedback

Purpose, Audience, and Goal are clear and concise. I understand your intention for this site but also keep in mind for future projects to have more detail in these sections. It will help define who you're trying to reach with a website. The personas you created are thoughtful and detailed. I look forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2α.

Your project and files are all set up to spec. Your code may need some clean up. There should not be any inline styling. I noticed a few height & width adjustments on your image tags. Also, the closing li tags should be at the end of every line. It does not need to be on a new line.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2α.


## Milestone 2a Feedback

Your content strategy and wire frames are simple and easy to understand. 
There were no errors in the html.

Milestone 2a Grade Tier 3

## Milestone 3 Feedback
- You know I'm a sucker for pets, don't you?
- Your visual design is clean and simple.  I suggest getting away from "bootstrap blue" to establish a more custom look for your site, but your sections are nicely delineated and have good spacing.  The font choice is simple, and contributes well to the look of the site.
- Nice work on the gallery implementation.  Good pictures, but I would suggest better captions.
- Your code is clean, with good indentation but I'd suggest some empty lines for readability.
- You've got a few warnings from the validator, though no errors.
- Your git commits are succinct and bite-sized.
- Your contact form looks good.

Overall, you have an effective site that gets your point across quickly and easily.  You have a direction, and you follow it.  I wish this site had just a little bit more to it.  That's the drawback to pet sites -- it's hard to provide enough content (aside from zillions of pictures) that are compelling to your everyday viewer.  Your overall visual style is effective, though I would suggest a little bit more deviation from the default bootstrap implementation.  A lot of people use bootstrap, so something that looks too "bootstrappy" can sometimes be a knock against a dev during an interview, for instance.  From a technical perspective, you have a minimal approach, but that's appropriate for a site of this scale.  It's well-implemented.
