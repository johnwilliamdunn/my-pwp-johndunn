		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Becky Benedict-Grandmother</li>
			<li>Becky is 62 years old and has suffered a traumatic brain injury leaving her unable to work or drive on her own. As a result she is home bound unless someone can driver her</li>
			<li>Becky likes to keep up with her kids and grand kids on Facebook since all of them live in different cities and states this makes it hard to visit ofter</li>
			<li>Becky does have an Android smart phone and a tablet she will be using to access my site and keep up with the updates provided for Lucy the Grand dog.</li>
			<li>Becky's brain injury has left her with a failing memory so she will need to bookmark the site to be able to return to it often since it will be outside of the Facebook framework she is used to.</li>
