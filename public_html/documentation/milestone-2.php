				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</div>
		<ul>
			<p>I am a stay at home dog that likes long walks at the park, eating cat poop, and barking at the mailman.
			I was born in the harsh lands of Southern New Mexico and lived the life of a wild Southern Chihuahua.
			I was found on the side of the road by a benevolent stranger who picked me up and took me into a kennel where I healed up and got stronger.
			When the kennel could no longer care for me I moved again, this time north to Albuquerque, I ended up in the East Mountains, where its very cold.
			My new home was called Lap Dog Rescue and I lived there for over a year with a bunch of other lapdogs from around the region.
			To tell the truth I don't like other dogs very much, I'm afraid they will want to fight me, so I tend to try to attack first.
			After being at Lapdog Rescue for over a year these Texans called named the Dunn's, they said they wanted to adopt me.
			If you ask the Dunn's they didn't know I was a Chihuahua, they thought I was some kind of terrier, suckers!

				<p>After I went to their tiny house the big surprise was I am a Chihuahua! It tuns out my predecessor was also a Chiweenie so they had some experience with my kind.
					But I'm a purebred, desert dog, where my predecessor was just a normal junkyard dog. As you can see I am far superior in my begging skills.
					I hope you enjoy keeping up with my adventures!
