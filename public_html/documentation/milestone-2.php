		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>This site will be on one page providing my dog with an outlet on the internet to reach her relatives in
				Texas. I will have some text introducing folks to Lucy and her life of leisure.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Section one will be a paragraph about Lucy's daily life and will be in tone playful and an introduction
				to the lapdog life
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Gallery</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Section 2 will be a scrollable gallery that can be scaled from mobile to desktop. The gallery will include
				4 still photos and 2 gifs or loops showing movement.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Contact Me</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Section 3 will be the contact me form section. This will include a name, email, subject and message fields
				within the form.
